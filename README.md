====================

My original code for grabbing CGM data via an Android device... not pretty!

This was my, learn as I go, need to build this to keep an eye on my 5 year-old, android application.

It is not well designed, properly implemented or remotely recommended for use. BE smart, do not make medical decisions based on any data it is gathering.

It is presented for educational purposes, feel free to clean it up and goof around with it.

To connect to the Dexcom G4, you will need a OTG USB cable.

The Dexcom USB port will break! It was not designed for frequent connect/disconnects. Get a spare:-) and be gentle.
